# Problem Statement:
Specific: Berlin’s cycling infrastructure is expanding rapidly, but accidents involving
cyclists remain frequent at certain intersections.
Measurable: Identify and visualize high-risk cycling zones; achieve ≥85% accuracy in
predicting accident likelihood based on historical data.
Achievable: Use open datasets from the Berlin Open Data Portal and implement
predictive analytics within 12 weeks.
Relevant: Combines machine learning, data visualization, and spatial analytics—key
domains of Data Science and Computer Science.
Time-bound: Project completion and evaluation within one academic semester.

# Abstract:
 Cycling is becoming increasingly popular in Berlin, but despite the city’s investment in new
cycling infrastructure, the number of road accidents involving cyclists remains a major
concern. This project proposes a data-driven solution to analyze, predict, and visualize
bicycle accident risks across Berlin. Using publicly available datasets from the Berlin Open
Data Portal—including traffic flow, weather, and historical accident data—the system will
apply machine learning algorithms to identify correlations between time, location, and
environmental factors. The predictive model will generate a Safety Heatmap that highlights
high-risk intersections and times of day, supporting urban planners, cyclists, and
policymakers in improving road safety. Expected outcomes include a model achieving at
least 85% predictive accuracy for accident risk and an interactive dashboard that
visualizes “danger zones” throughout the city. This project demonstrates the practical
application of Data Science for urban safety, using real-world data and interpretable
machine learning methods.

# Expected Outcome:
Provide data-backed evidence to city officials and planners for prioritizing safer cycling
infrastructure improvements.
Enable public awareness through clear visualization of accident-prone areas.
Contribute to Berlin’s broader vision of sustainable and safe mobility by reducing cyclist
accident rates over time.
